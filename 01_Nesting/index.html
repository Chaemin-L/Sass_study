            <h2>Nesting</h2>
            When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.
            Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly
             nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.
            With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a site's navigation:
            <br>
            <i>https://sass-lang.com/guide</i>
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
